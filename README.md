# 📊 COVID-19 Data Analysis with Python (India Focus)

This project analyzes global and Indian COVID-19 trends using the “Corona Virus Report” dataset from Kaggle. It demonstrates how to process time-series data, visualize key pandemic metrics, and derive insights using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.



## 📁 Dataset
	•	Source: Kaggle - Corona Virus Report
	•	File Used: covid_19_clean_complete.csv
	•	Fields: Date, Country/Region, Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, etc.

## 🎯 Objectives
	•	Analyze the overall COVID-19 trends globally.
	•	Perform focused analysis of COVID-19 progression in India.
	•	Visualize the number of confirmed, recovered, and death cases over time.
	•	Extract key insights as of the latest available data.



## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
	•	Python
	•	Pandas
	•	Matplotlib
